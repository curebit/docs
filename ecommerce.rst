Curebit Integration Options
###########################

Curebit integrates with e-commerce platforms or custom web sites through
JavaScript calls to our API. But most customers can integrate quickly **without
knowing how to code**.

The standard integration provides end-to-end referral tracking and displays
offers via popup after purchase. Other features are optional.

   <h2>E-commerce Custom Integration</h2>

If you're not using one of these shopping carts, you can still use Curebit.
With our :ref:`custom integration <ecommerce/custom>` option, you just copy
a few lines of JavaScript to your order confirmation page and you're ready to go.

   <h2>E-commerce Platform Integration</h2>

If you use one of the shopping carts listed below, you can use a supported
extension to integrate Curebit. It's often as easy as copying and pasting code,
and we provide instructions.
