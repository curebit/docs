On the order confirmation page the following integration script needs to be included:

.. include:: /samples/ecommerce/custom/post_purchase_basic.rst

Including Product Items
-----------------------

You can also add product specific tracking to Talkable, which will let your customers share specific items that they've purchased. Customer shares with products have higher click through and conversion rates.

Below is an example with product items passed along with purchase data (notice FOR loop):

.. include:: /samples/optional/product_items.rst

.. note::

  All product items are included into Purchase details inside Purchases report. This information is helpful for debugging.
