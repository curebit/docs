Advocate/Friend Reward Confirmation Email
-----------------------------------------

Main purpose of this email is to send a Reward via email, and remind about
it in the future. |br|
Email is triggered to a |advocate| or a |friend| who passed Email Gating, and received Reward
(i.e. coupon code). |br|

Use Email sending condition to differentiate |advocate| from |friend| email.

Here is an example of a Friend Reward Confirmation Email:

.. raw:: html

  <pre>{% if reward.incentive.identifier == 'click' %}
    true
  {% endif %}</pre>

The email will be sent once Talkable knows Friend's email which they provides on the Friend Claim Page (such technique works great for email capturing). See :ref:`tutorials_email_gating` for more details.

You can see your Incentive identifier inside Campaign Rules:

  ``{{ proceed_to_merchant_path }}``.
