Advocate Offer Email
--------------------

Email is triggered to an |advocate| on sign up. Explain the value proposition
and encourage |advocate| to share using the buttons.

- For Standalone Campaign it triggers when |advocate| signs up.
- For Post-Checkout Campaign it triggers when |advocate| makes store purchase.
  It is not recommended to use this email here since it may look spammy.

Main |cta| should point to an Advocate Share Page â€” ``{{ share_page_url }}``.
