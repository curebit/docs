Designer
========

Web view size
-------------

Make sure Advocate Signup Page canvas size is equal to the Advocate Share Page, because
this is a next screen referrer sees right after, there should be a
smooth transition between these pages. Canvas size should be equal to a
main container width of your site:

   :alt: Page canvas size

For mobile screens most common width is 320px, but we also support fluid
width with possibility to set it to 100% to support mobile devices and
tablets. Since Talkable integration is based on ``iframe`` it is not
possible to change its size from within of the iframe thatâ€™s why Signup
and Share pages should always be of the same size.

For Post-purchase campaign Advocate Share Page should look like a modal window
cause it integrates right to the checkout page after user makes a
purchase (most common size is 800x500px):

   :alt: Advocate Share Page like a modal

.. note:: Overlay cannot be customized.

Friend Claim Page size does not matter cause it hosts on Talkable site
entirely. Commonly this view looks like a modal window with customer
site loaded on the back:

   :alt: Friend Claim Page

Most common modal size is 800x500px.


.. _designer/email:

Email size
----------

Ideally email width is 480px for content:

Fonts
-----

Using custom fonts as text allowed only for web views, **not emails**.
This is email clients restriction. If its needed, we can convert custom
font to images but it will not be editable through campaign editor and
each copy change will require more time. Here is a list of OS default
fonts http://www.ampsoft.net/webdesign-l/WindowsMacFonts.html

Also, for emails copy should be placed always on top of solid background
color, not image:

.. image:: /_static/img/liquid/designer/image5.png
   :alt: Solid color VS image

There are many options for embedding custom fonts, here are most popular
and solid ones:

1. Purchase web-compatible font on http://myfonts.com

2. Purchase on http://typekit.com

3. Choose free Google Font http://www.google.com/fonts



.. _responsive-views:

Responsive view's height
------------------------

Talkable provides flexibility for the merchant to decide how they want to
optimize mobile.

If your site is responsive, all you'll need to do is to set ``Responsive: Yes``
in ``Campaign | View Setup | Extra``.

In your campaign, there are different views for mobile, tablet and desktop.
We'll automatically pull the correct theme view based on the user's device
once we detect the viewport. We'll use our responsive engine to size the
Talkable iframe to the right size. Like Magic!

If you have separate mobile, tablet and desktop sites (or any combination of
the three), you can leave ``Responsive: Yes`` on but also specifically set the
campaign theme view to use. This will prevent Talkable from automatically
assigning the theme view to use, but will allow us to resize within the screen
to make sure all elements fit well.

Make sure you have this CSS in your campaign theme so it won't have a double
scrollbars on resize (if ``Responsive: Yes``)

.. code:: css

   body { overflow: hidden; }
