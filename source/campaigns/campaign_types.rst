Campaign Types
==============

Campaign Types exist to support different goals of your Referral Marketing activities.
|br|
Campaign Type also defines which layout the Campaignâ€™s view pages have.

Invite
------

The Invite campaigns are very powerful and versatile.
They increase the number of new customers by giving anyone an opportunity to invite their Friends
from various high traffic locations on the website as well as outside the website.
You can set up multiple Invite campaigns to run simultaneously.

Advocate Dashboard
------------------

The Advocate Dashboard campaigns provide the Advocates a great insight on each of
their shares as well as their associated rewards. The Advocates are motivated to share more
to achieve more rewards and can make that directly from their Dashboards.

Reward Gleam
------------

The Reward Gleam improves the on-site conversion rate by assisting Friends and Advocates
in using their coupons to purchase. When the Friend or Advocate gets a reward and goes to your
website the Reward Gleam captures the coupon code and displays it in a highlight bar at the bottom of the page.
This type of campaign focuses on both Friends and Advocates and can be the perfect addition to any of your other campaigns.
