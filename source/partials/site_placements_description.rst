It is all about the referral loop. Define a place where do you want your customers see Talkable campaign at. This is a place from where they will be inviting their friends — we call it "opening the loop":
  1. :ref:`Post Purchase <optional/site_placements/post_purchase>` — on the order confirmation page after checkout
  2. :ref:`Invite <optional/site_placements/invite>` — on the standalone page that's always available to anyone
  3. On the homepage as an email capture popup to everyone who visits
  4. Inside user account section as a dashboard which includes tracking history and reminder functionality
  5. On every page as a floating button in a corner of the screen so customers are able to access Talkable campaign from anywhere on the site without being distracted from what they are looking for
  6. All of the above **(recommended)**. The more places you integrate Talkable into the more boost you get from referrals channel.
