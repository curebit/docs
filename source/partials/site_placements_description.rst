Define a place where do you want your customers see Talkable campaign at. This is a place from where they will be inviting their friends â€” we call it "opening the loop":

.. list-table::
   :widths: 35 65

   * - :ref:`post_purchase_campaign`
     - On the order confirmation page after checkout
   * - :ref:`invite_campaign`
     - On the standalone page that's always available to anyone
   * - Every Visitor Popup
     - On every page as an email capture popup to everyone who visits your site
   * - Dashboard
     - Inside user account section as a dashboard which includes tracking history and reminder functionality
   * - Floating Widget Popup
     - On every page as a floating button in a corner of the screen so customers are able to access Talkable campaign from anywhere on the site without being distracted from what they are looking for

.. note::

  The more places you integrate Talkable into the more boost you get from Referral as a marketing channel.
