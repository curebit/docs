To ensure the campaign is loaded as fast as possible with no delay, it is
important that you place your integration script inside the HEAD tag.
In order to make sure your campaign will load properly from the HEAD tag we
will have to enable/uncomment the "container" option in the integration script
(`image <http://monosnap.com/image/wqwOGo7tvIMQlkwoLfUoAs6Hf1E4Iz>`_).

Once you have placed your integration script inside the HEAD tag, and you have
defined the iframe container parameter, then you will be able to set up an empty
block with id = container parameter from integration script. Now that you have
defined the campaign Container ID, your campaign will be inserted anywhere on
your page where the container id is identified.
