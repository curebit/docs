Post Share Webhook
==================

Talkable Post Share Webhook provides notification of a share event performed within a referral campaign workflow. Use cases for the Post Share Webhook include:

  * Sending automated 'Thank You' email to an Advocate for performing a share
  * Any event that should be triggered when a user shares
  * Data for Business Intelligence and analytics systems

   <h2>When does Talkable call the Post Share Webhook?</h2>

Talkable Post Share Webhook is triggered any time an |advocate| (referrer) shares offer details with a |friend| (referee) via the corresponding form provided by campaign workflow. Which includes any time:

  * An advocate shares with a Friend via Email or any other channel from inside a referral campaign workflow
  * An Advocate copies a share link from a referral campaign workflow share screen

Note: the Post Share Webhook triggers every time a share occurs. For example, if an Advocate shares with a Friend via email (or any channel), then shares with a second Friend via email (or any channel), the Post Share Webhook will be triggered twice.
