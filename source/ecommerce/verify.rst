Verifying Integration
=====================

After installing Talkable, you should verify that the integration is working.
All you have to do is check out from your store using the special email
integration@talkable.com.

1. Do a test checkout on your online store and use integration@talkable.com
   as the customer email address.
2. After checking out, you should see an integration success page that looks
   like this:

   .. image:: /_static/img/integration_success.png
      :width: 300 px
      :alt: Integration Success

   (Don't worry. This image is only shown when you use the special
   integration@talkable.com email address. No one else is seeing that image.)

If you can't complete checkout with integration@talkable.com, we'll also verify
your integration whenever someone completes checkout on your store (but they
won't see anything).
