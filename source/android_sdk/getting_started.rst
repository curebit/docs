Getting Started
===============

The Getting Started guide shows you how to setup and launch Referral Campaign as quickly as possible with Talkable Android SDK.


Installation
------------

1. Download the latest version of `Talkable SDK framework`.
2. Add `talkable.jar` to `libs` directory
3. Setup Talkable credentials in `AndroidManifest.xml` in `<application>...</application>`:

  .. code-block:: xml

      <meta-data android:name="TalkableApiKey" android:value="{{YOUR_TALKABLE_API_KEY}}" />
      <meta-data android:name="TalkableSiteSlug" android:value="{{YOUR_SITE_SLUG}}" />

  .. note::

    You can locate your credentials inside Talkable site:

    - Visit https://www.talkable.com/account/sites to find you site slug
    - Select site and go to **Dashboard** |rarr| **Site Settings**.
      Find **Integration settings** section and there you will see the API Key

4. Add the following entry in your `AndroidManifest.xml` file to track app installs.

  .. code-block:: xml

      <receiver
          android:name="com.talkable.InstallReferrerReceiver"
          android:exported="true">
          <intent-filter>
              <action android:name="com.android.vending.INSTALL_REFERRER" />
          </intent-filter>
      </receiver>

5. Initialize Talkable in your main activity class, like so:

  .. code-block:: java

    import com.talkable.*;

    public class MainActivity extends Activity {
        @Override
        public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
            ...

            Talkable.initialize(this);
        }
    }

6. Add the following import statement to any file in which you wish to use the Talkable SDK.

  .. code-block:: java

    import com.talkable.*;

Your environment is all set up! Now you need to :ref:`integrate <android_sdk/integration>` the Talkable campaign piece.
