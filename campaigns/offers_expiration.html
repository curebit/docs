<h1>Offers Expiration<a class="headerlink" href="#offers-expiration" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Talkable Campaign allows to set offer expiration for <abbr title="Person, who shares an offer with their Friend(s)">Advocate</abbr> and <abbr title="Person, who is invited to participate in Campaign by Advocate">Friend</abbr>
by specifying specific date or setting offer duration in hours.</p>
<h2>Advocate</h2><ul class="simple">
<li><code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Advocate</span> <span class="pre">deadline</span></code> - <abbr title="Person, who shares an offer with their Friend(s)">Advocate</abbr> will no longer be able to share after this date.</li>
<li>All existing <abbr title="Person, who shares an offer with their Friend(s)">Advocate</abbr> offers are always affected if specified date is changed
while campaign is live.</li>
<li><abbr title="Person, who shares an offer with their Friend(s)">Advocate</abbr> Deadline is not copied when campaign is copied.</li>
<li>When campaign is deactivated, all <abbr title="Person, who shares an offer with their Friend(s)">Advocate</abbr> offers instantly become expired because deactivating a campaign is equal to set <abbr title="Person, who shares an offer with their Friend(s)">Advocate</abbr> offer deadline to now.</li>
<li>When <abbr title="Person, who shares an offer with their Friend(s)">Advocate</abbr> offer is expired, <abbr title="Person, who shares an offer with their Friend(s)">Advocate</abbr> is still eligible for reward.
In other words Advocate offer expiration only prevents <abbr title="Person, who shares an offer with their Friend(s)">Advocate</abbr> from sharing but not from getting rewarded.</li>
<li>This setting doesn’t affect <abbr title="Person, who is invited to participate in Campaign by Advocate">Friend</abbr> reward in any way.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Friend</h2><ul class="simple">
<li><code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Friend</span> <span class="pre">Deadline</span></code> - <abbr title="Person, who is invited to participate in Campaign by Advocate">Friend</abbr> will no longer be able to claim the offer after this date.</li>
<li><code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Friend</span> <span class="pre">Offer</span> <span class="pre">Duration</span></code> - <abbr title="Person, who is invited to participate in Campaign by Advocate">Friend</abbr> will no longer be able to claim the offer X
hours after <abbr title="Person, who shares an offer with their Friend(s)">Advocate</abbr> shared it with him. Leave blank to disable expiration at all.</li>
<li>All existing <abbr title="Person, who is invited to participate in Campaign by Advocate">Friend</abbr> offers will be affected if specified date or offer duration is
changed while campaign is live.</li>
<li>If a deadline and an offer duration are both specified, <abbr title="Person, who is invited to participate in Campaign by Advocate">Friend</abbr> offer will be expired on
the closest date calculated from offer duration or specified in deadline.</li>
<li><abbr title="Person, who is invited to participate in Campaign by Advocate">Friend</abbr> offer deadline should never be earlier than <abbr title="Person, who shares an offer with their Friend(s)">Advocate</abbr> offer deadline
(because there is no sense to share offer that cannot be claimed).</li>
<li>When <abbr title="Person, who is invited to participate in Campaign by Advocate">Friend</abbr> offer is expired, <abbr title="Person, who is invited to participate in Campaign by Advocate">Friend</abbr> and <abbr title="Person, who shares an offer with their Friend(s)">Advocate</abbr> are not able to receive any rewards.
But they still may try to use coupon they received earlier because talkable platform doesn’t control coupon expiration. Only merchant site does that.</li>
<li>When campaign is copied only offer duration gets copied, but not deadline.</li>
