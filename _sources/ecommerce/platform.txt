Platform Integration
====================

Talkable is easy to integrate into your eCommerce website. Stores using Magento
or Shopify can simply include our extension or application. Select your shopping
cart on the left.

For other platforms or custom stores, all that is required is the addition of
a :ref:`javascript tag <ecommerce/custom>` on your final checkout receipt page
(post transaction). Check out the :ref:`custom integration <ecommerce/custom>`
instructions.

When your customer completes an order, Talkable will determine if they are
redeeming an offer or if there are any available deals on the products the
customer has purchased.
