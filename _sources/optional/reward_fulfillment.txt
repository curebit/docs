Reward Fulfillment
==================

You can choose to handle referral rewards on your own, using our dashboard to
keep track of referrals earned and paid. Or you can have Curebit handle cash
rewards. Curebit pays cash rewards via Paypal, in some days after rewards are
earned. You can void rewards for returns, or testing purchases.
