Automatic Coupon Creation
=========================

You can reward |advocate| and their |friend| with coupons. Talkable supports both
one-time-use coupons as well as multi-use coupons. If you are using one-time-use
coupons there is a need to refill a list of coupons within Talkable. You will need
to export a list of coupons or provide a multi-use coupon code creation end point.
