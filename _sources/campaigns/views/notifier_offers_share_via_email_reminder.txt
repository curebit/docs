Friend Share Email Reminder
---------------------------

Email is triggered only if Friend Share Email Reminder checkbox was checked
on the :ref:`developer_advocate_share_page` when sharing. |br|
By default reminder email sends out in 72 hours after sharing if Friend didn't
use his Offer (i.e. didn't make a store purchase using coupon code).

Main |cta| should point to a Friend Claim Page â€” ``{{ short_url }}``. |br|
To change email trigger delay open ``Editor`` / ``Extra fields`` for the
particular email.
